# Multivariate-Statistics

## Objective
Analyse a dataset to demonstrate your ability to perform multivariate data analysis, including
clustering, dimensionality reduction, and topological data analysis. Extend the methodologies
from lectures to a higher level in terms of methodology, graphics, and presentation of results.

## Dataset:the Spotify Tracks dataset, available at
https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-
dataset/blob/main/dataset.csv

## Report
### 1.Research question definition
* Formulate a unique research question or objective related to the dataset
* Explain the significance of your question and what you aim to discover through your
analysis

### 2.Data selection and pre-processing
* Did you subset the data (i.e. chosen a subset of the data relevant to your research
question, e.g. specific genres, years, popularity ranges)? Why?
* Which preprocessing steps did you take? Why?
	* Handle missing values, if any
	* Encode categorical variables
	* Scale or normalise features as appropriate
### 3.Multivariate analysis strategy
(max 1 page)
Describe the following (actual code should be in appendix):
* Which methods did you use? Choose suitable clustering algorithms, dimensionality
reduction techniques, and/or topological data analysis
* Why did you select these? Explain why these methods are appropriate for your analysis.
* Did you explore the e]ect of di]erent parameters? Why? How?


### 4. Analysis and results
(max 3 pages)
This section will show actual results after you applied your chosen algorithms.
• Provide visualisations of the results (max 25% of contents of this section = 0.5 pages total)
• Interpret the results in the context of your research question

### 5. Interpretation and insights
(max 0.75 pages)
• Summarise the key findings for your analysis
• Discuss the implications of your results in relation to your research question
• Acknowledge any limitations in your analysis and suggest potential improvements

### 6. Reflection
(max 0.25 pages)
• Reflect on what you learned during the assignment
• Discuss any challenges you faced and how you addressed them
• Provide thoughts on how this analysis could be extended or applied in real-world contexts

### 7. Collaboration (if a team)
If you collaborated on your projects with someone else for coding assistance (pair programming),
mention in this section who you collaborated with.


### Report Format:
Structure:
* Title and author information (name, student number, master programme)
* The sections mentioned above
* Code appendix 
  * Code for data preprocessing
  * Code for data analysis
  * Code for visualisation
